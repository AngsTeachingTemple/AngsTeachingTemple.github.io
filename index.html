var teachingNotes = ["<h1>Algebra Terminology 10/05/2022</h1><p>In algebra, letters can be used to stand for numbers. A pronumeral is a letter that stands for a number.<br>If a pronumeral could represent any number rather than just one, it is also called a variable.<br>a x b is written as ab and a ÷ b is written as b. A term consists of numbers and pronumerals combined with multiplication or division.<br>For example, 5 is a term, x is a term, 9a is a term, abc is a term, 47z is a term.<br>A term that does not contain any pronumerals is called a constant term. All numbers by themselves are constant terms.<br>An (algebraic) expression consists of numbers and pronumerals combined with any mathematical operations.<br>For example, 3x + 2yz is an expression and 8 ÷ (3a — 2b) + 41 is also an expression. Any term is also an expression.<br>A coefficient is the number in front of a pronumeral. For example, the coefficient of y in the expression 8x + 2y + z is 2.<br>If there is no number in front, then the coefficient is 1, since 1 z and z are equal. </p>", 
"<h1>Combining Like Terms 13/05/2022</h1><p>Like terms are terms containing exactly the same pronumerals, although not necessarily in the same order.<br>• 5ab and 3ab are like terms. • 4a and 7b are not like terms. • 2acb and 4bac are like terms.<br>Like terms can be combined within an expression to create a simpler expression that is equivalent.<br>For example, 5ab + 3ab can be simplified to 8ab. If two terms are not like terms (such as 4x and 5y),<br>they can still be added to get an expression like 4x + 5y, but this expression cannot be simplified further.</p>"
